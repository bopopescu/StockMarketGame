<h1>Stock Market Game</h1><h2>Overview</h2>This application is a game to teach people about markets.  It is called the Stock Market Game, but encompasses many different types of instruments.  The first one I will start with is crypto currency.  One of the reasons fo this is that it is easy to get real-time data from the exchanges.  Stock data you need to go make calls to websites.  I will work on that soon. <h2>Current Modules</h2>  <ul><li>GDAXFeedHandler (get last trade information from GDAX.  I did not want to process entire books.  I just need best bid and offer.)</li> 
<li>DBWriter (This writes top of book messages to the database with the last sequence number that I published)</li><li>SMGExchange (This is the one that will execute trades.  It gets market data and  orders sent to it.  It will also save orders and fills to database)</li><li>SMGSimulator (This generates orders on a timer and does a round robin on five different crypto currency products).</li></ul><h2>Technology</h2><ul><il>Kafka (messaging). I find this easy to use since all you really need to do is publish and subscribe.  I want to keep all processess small.</il><il>MySql (database).  Huge fan of MySQL database.  Easy to use.  Easy to scale.</il></ul><h3>Contact Information</h3> Any questions you can email me at estigum@gmail.com
